# project-slice

Auto split project.

> Now I have to split a project from a large one.  
> As an annoyance driven deveploper, I have the idea.

## Main Idea

1. Collect the dependencies of the aimed project, and then copy to target dir.

2. Use config file to include extra files not in dependencies

3. Css, images, and fonts should also be included in.
